## How I found out about SSIs


## Why this solution (requirements)
- Modularized html files so that can be
  - simplified as much as possible into small units
  - put into isolated directory where editor have access to
  - accessed from a remote path (such as Dropbox, etc.)
  - can be parsed from Markdown (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#markdown)
- Isn't it cool to use technology from to solve a complex problem people still have trouble with todayÂ¿
- It's an elegant solution to a common difficulty/headache we still have today... and it's using core Apache Server technology - NO server-side programming
- Faster and smaller toll on the server. If it can be done with less (PHP, MYSQL, etc.), why not?
- This example is configured to be used with [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/ssi.html), but not much effort would be needed to make it work with [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssi_module.html)

```html
<section data-markdown="example.md" data-separator="^\n\n\n" data-vertical="^\n\n"></section>
```

```html
<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
        <!--#include virtual="/includes/200_html.inc" -->
    </script>
</section>
